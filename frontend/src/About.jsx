                  Welcome! I'm Casandra Newhard, a certified Access Bars practitioner dedicated to guiding individuals toward a life of greater ease, joy, and consciousness. My journey into energy work began with a desire to find deeper peace and clarity in my own life. Discovering Access Bars was transformative, and it ignited a passion to share this gentle yet powerful modality with others. I believe everyone has the capacity to release limitations and create the life they truly desire. It is my honor to hold a safe, nurturing space for your transformation.

                  Access Bars is a hands-on energy healing process that uses light touch on 32 points on the head. These "Bars" store the electromagnetic components of all the thoughts, ideas, attitudes, decisions, and beliefs that you have ever had about anything. A session is a chance to let go of everything! Imagine it as deleting old, cluttered files from your computer's hard drive, allowing more space for what truly matters.

                  Developed by Gary Douglas in the 1990s, Access Bars is the foundational tool of Access ConsciousnessÂ®, a set of life-changing techniques and tools designed to empower you to know that you know. The core philosophy is not about finding answers, but about living in the question, continuously opening doors to new possibilities. It encourages you to step out of judgment and into a state of allowing, where you can receive everything the universe has to offer without limitation.
